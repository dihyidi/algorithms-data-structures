**Laboratory work 2 (data structures)**

One of the data structures should be implemented. Mine is *priority queue*.

You should perform the operations of inserting, returning an element without deleting, deleting (for example, returning and deleting the first element from the stack), and finding a specific element (if such an operation is supported by the data structure).

**How to run:**
1. Clone the repo. (git clone *url*)
2. Open cmd and go to the folder containing **Lab2.csproj**.
3. Run **dotnet run**.
