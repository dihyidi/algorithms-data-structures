**Laboratory 1**

Your task is to implement a sorting algorithm. 

The input data is a one-dimensional array of numbers, which is written through a comma and can be run as follows:
python merge_sort.py asc 1,2,56,45, -9,78,11
java MergeSort.java desc 1,2,56,45, -9,78,11
asc - ascending
desc - descending
That is, your code must be able to sort ascending and descending.

The result should display:
* the name of the algorithm
* work time
* the number of comparison operations that were performed during the operation of the algorithm
* the number of exchange operations that were performed during the operation of the algorithm
* sorting results

**How to run:**
1. Clone the repo. (git clone *url*)
2. Open cmd and go to the folder containing **Lab1.csproj**.
3. Run **dotnet run [input params]**.
